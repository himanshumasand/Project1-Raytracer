CUDA RAYTRACER


FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

- I have completed all the necessary parts of the project.
- In the 2 additional features, I have implemented anti-aliasing and specular reflection.
- In the input scene file, 'REFL' is used to control the amount of reflectivity of the object.
- My raytracer currently handles only 1 light source since I haven't used an array for storing lights. The current light source is inside the roof and the area light object. Therefore, I have hardcoded the index of those objects so that they are not considered while checking for intersections from the light source.


SCREENSHOTS:

- Screenshots of the renders are in the 'renders' directory.
